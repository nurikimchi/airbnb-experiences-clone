# Airbnb Experiences Clone, Introducing: Groundbnb
A static page from Section 2 of Scrimba's "Learn React for Free" course using React props.

## Description
A static, semi-responsive (hopefully), React page that focuses on using props. It displays four mock experiences that each contains a location, a Google Maps URL, title, date and description. Data for each mock experience card is found in [data.js](data.js).<br>
I used CSS grid as the parent element with two flexbox child elements to display small details (location, Google Maps URL) and large details (title, date and description).
